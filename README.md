# React Slide-Creater App (using Firebase)
**This React application is a note-taking tool with a split view interface. Users can create, edit, and delete notes, with changes automatically synced to Firestore. The app features a sidebar for note navigation and an editor for note content. It uses Firebase for data management and implements debouncing to optimize updates.**

#Technologies Used:
**React: For building the user interface and managing state.
useState: Manages state for notes, the current note ID, and temporary note text.
useEffect: Handles side effects such as syncing data from Firestore, updating the current note ID when notes change, and implementing debouncing for note updates.
Firebase Firestore: For real-time data synchronization and storage of notes.
React-Split: For creating a resizable split-view interface.
CSS: For styling the components and layout.**
